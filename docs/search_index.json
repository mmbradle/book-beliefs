Nothing—no duty, no law, no morality, no religion—goes beyond holiness. If God asked us to do something that was outside the scope of holiness, he would be asking us to do something beyond what he is. On the other hand, if God accepted something less than holiness from us then his standard would not be holy and he would not be holy. Holiness is the beginning, end, and everything in between of what God is and what God requires us to be. If the sole text of the Bible was “Be holy, because I am holy,” that would suffice to show us God’s standard. 1 The story of the Bible can be summarized by God looking down on mankind to find anyone who is holy and not seeing a single person, nor a single moment in a single person, nor a single motive in a single moment in a single person lining up with his standard. Then Jesus, comes on the scene, and all of God’s heart is completely satisfied in this man who is holy, like how God is holy. Jesus shares this holiness with us. It’s his and he gives it to us. There is no other source for it. It has nothing to do with our actions meritoriously speaking. We don’t earn it, it is a gift. But without it, we cannot please God in any way. Without holiness, we are filthy. With it, we are clean. 1.2 Ways We Use “Holiness” To speak about the “otherness” or “transcendence” of God To speak about the splendor and majesty of God To speak about the oneness of God To speak about the summation of the attributes of God To speak about our conformity to the likeness to God which we have in Jesus together with the various things we do as a result of that “principle” of holiness. In other words holiness is both the river and the fruit that is born of that river. To speak of a separation unto God of persons or things, e.g. the holy curtains in the tabernacle. 1.3 What Holiness Is Not If there is one word to get to understand our family’s religion it is this one. Yet if there is a more off-putting word to most people, I do not know what it is. I suspect this is a result of the misuse by many of this word to mean one of these other things. Holiness is not morality Holiness is not about performing religious duties Holiness has very little to do with our behavior Holiness is not avoiding certain sins Holiness is not always visible We have no power towards holiness at all Anything we initiate is not a part of our holiness (born of the flesh) 1.4 Quotes He is the eternal spring and only fountain of all holiness; there is nothing of it in any creature but what is directly and immediately from him; there was not in our first creation. He made us in his own image. And to suppose that we can now sanctify or make ourselves holy is proudly to renounce and cast off our principal dependence upon him. Holiness is nothing but the implanting, writing, and realizing of the gospel in our souls. There neither is, nor ever was, in the world, nor ever shall be, the least dram of holiness, but what, flowing from Jesus Christ, is communicated by the Spirit, according to the truth and promise of the gospel. Wherefore holiness, with the fruits of it, with respect unto their proper ends, … is all that God requireth of us. It is one thing to have holiness really thriving in any soul, another for that soul to know it and to be satisfied in it Owen reference needed↩︎ "],["experimental.html", "Chapter 2 Experimental 2.1 Christianity that only works if… 2.2 Experimental / Experiential / Sensible 2.3 Not All Religion 2.4 Experimental Communion 2.5 Regarding Detractors 2.6 Quotes", " Chapter 2 Experimental 2.1 Christianity that only works if… Most people’s religion involves beliefs and practices that would work whether or not God is real. The best religion though is a religion that would not work if God were not real. Think of David or Jonah or Moses. The things they did would not have worked without a real God. That’s how we want our religion to be, that is experimental. 2.2 Experimental / Experiential / Sensible We use the terms experimental, experiential, sensible fairly interchangeably. In all of them, God has to supply the other half of the experiment. We pray, and the prayer in answered—good. We pray and the prayer is not answered—we ask “why?” Perhaps we cherished iniquity in our heart 2, perhaps we were not seeking God’s kingdom first 3, perhaps we were not praying according to a promise 4, perhaps is is simply for God’s glory that he does not answer 5. In any case it is an experiment, the answer to which is a sensible (able to be sensed) experience or lack thereof. 2.3 Not All Religion This isn’t to say everything in Christianity is to be experimental. Sometimes the best kind of faith is a faith that believes when it cannot see 6, but along with that, tasting and seeing that the Lord is good 7 is also faith, a faith that is based on the experience of things hoped for. 2.4 Experimental Communion The area of life this comes into play the most often is looking God’s presence. When we look for him and don’t find him. That is experimental. When we look for him and find him, that is also experimental. I’ll discuss communion with God in another chapter, but it is the heart of true religion and thus true religion must be experimental. 2.5 Regarding Detractors Lastly, you will run into many people who disagree with this notion. Sometimes the disagreement is merely one of semantics, but more often people disagree with the core claim. To them I quote John 3, “unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God,” and both being born again and seeing the kingdom of God are the exact kind of experiences we are asserting as essential. 2.6 Quotes Experience is the food of all grace Now, he administereth comfort no other way but by giving unto the minds and souls of believers a spiritual, sensible experience of the reality and power of the things we do believe. The soul finding not Christ present in his wonted manner, warming, cherishing, reviving it with love, nigh to it, supping with it, always filling its thoughts with himself … it presently inquires into the cause of all this … Here it accomplished a diligent search; it considers the love, tenderness, and kindness of the Lord Jesus, what delight he takes in abiding with his saints, so that his departure is not without cause and provocation. “How” saith it, “have I demeaned myself, that I have lost my Beloved? where have I been wandering after other lovers?” And when the miscarriage is found out, it abounds in revenge and indignation. As a man that hath a jewel of great price, having no occasion to use it, lays it aside, as he supposes, in a safe place; in an agony and extremity of want going to seek for his jewel, he finds it not in the place he expected, and is filled with amazement, and knows not what to do;—so is it with this pearl of the gospel. After a man hath sold all that he hath for it, and enjoyed it for a season, then to have it missing at a time of need, it must needs perplex him. So was it with the spouse here. “I sought him,” saith she, “but I found him not;” a thing which not seldom befalls us in our communion with Christ. It often so falls out in our communion with Christ, when private and public means fail, and the soul hath nothing left but waiting silently and walking humbly, Christ appears; that his so doing may be evidently of grace. I shall crave leave to say, that he who hath no experience of spiritual shame and self-abhorrency, upon the account of this inconformity of his nature and the faculties of his soul unto the holiness of God, is a great stranger unto this whole work of sanctification. And generally this [ruin or imparing] is so when men content themselves, as was said, with the notions of truth, without labouring after an experience of the power of them in their hearts, and the bringing forth the fruit of them in their lives, on which a decay must needs ensue.

It is a humbling thing to have to set your hope in a God who you do not understand. I suspect many have not really humbled themselves in this way, but have settled for serving a God who is too understandable, too like them, and thus, too boring 8 9. If it can be accepted that God is three in one, then it should not be too hard to accept that salvation is also three in one. I could write this better if I knew how much that link was intentional and how much it is accidental, but I’ll leave that for you to reason out. What I mean by salvation is three in one is mainly that there is a past, a present, and a future aspect to salvation. But there is not 3 salvations but one salvation. But the 3 are not the parts of salvation but that each aspect of salvation is in actuality the whole thing. Words fail. I’ll take a few stabs at this: 3.2 A Philisophical Approach In Latin, Modus Ponens means “method of affirming.” It is a rule of inference used to draw logical conclusions that states that if p is true, and if \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) (read “p implies q”), then q is true. In this case you could say that p is a sufficient condition of q and that q is a necessary condition of p. 3.2.1 Modus Ponens If it is a salad, it has vegetables. St.Paul Chop is a salad. Therefore, St.Paul Chop has vegetables. \\[\\frac{salad \\rightarrow vegetables, salad}{\\therefore vegetables}\\] 3.2.2 Modus Tollens If it is a salad, it has vegetables. Fruit salad does not have vegetables. Therefore, fruit salad is not salad. \\[\\frac{salad \\rightarrow vegetables, \\neg salad}{\\therefore \\neg vegetables}\\] 3.2.3 Affirming the consequent If it is a salad, it has vegetables. A BLT has vegetables. Therefore, BLTs are salads. \\[\\frac{salad \\rightarrow vegetables, vegetables}{\\therefore salad}\\] In the above example regarding salads and vegetables. You could say it is necessary for a salad to have vegetables (q is necessary for p). You could also say that eating salad is sufficient for eating your vegetables (p is sufficient for q). Lastly, sometimes things are necessary and sufficient conditions for each other (\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)), but this is not always the case. When people reason wrongly along these lines, they are making the error called “affirming the consequent.” For example thinking BLTs are salads because they have vegetables. This would only be true if vegetables are necessary and sufficient for salads, which they are not. But being an unmarried man is both necessary and sufficient for being a bachelor, in this case p implies q and q implies p (\\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\)). Easy right? This can be helpful for Christian reasoning. For example: (\\(pleasing \\rightarrow believing\\)) Believing that God exists is necessary for pleasing God, but is belief in God sufficient for pleasing God? No, because even the demons believe. (\\(grace \\rightarrow works\\)) Grace is sufficient for good works God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. But do good works always show grace? Can man do good without God? Is it \\(grace \\leftrightarrow works\\) or merely \\(grace \\rightarrow works\\)? (\\(faith \\leftrightarrow salvation\\)) Faith is both necessary and sufficient for salvation. If we believe we will be saved and no one will be saved who does not believe. 3.2.4 Salvation as Justification, Sanctification, and Glorification In our Christianity, we would claim all of the following: Justification is both necessary and sufficient for salvation Sanctification is both necessary and sufficient for salvation Glorification is both necessary and sufficient for salvation As a result of thinking this way, we would also say that: Justification, sanctification, and glorification are all necessary and sufficient for each other. Going around the Trinity Shield with this would yield: Justification is not Sanctification is not Glorification is not Justification. But Justification is Salvation and Salvation is Justification. Sanctification is Salvation and Salvation is Sanctification. Glorification is Salvation and Salvation is Glorification. It’s a simple concept. But Christians get it wrong often and this leads to problems. 3.3 Analogical Approaches Another way to look at it is that justification is most related to Jesus, sanctification is most related to the Spirit, and glorification is most related to the Father. Another way is to say justification is most related to Jesus’ work on the cross, sanctification is most related to Jesus’ work in his life, and glorification is most related to Jesus’ resurrection. Another way is to say that the Bible speaks of a past, present, and future salvation. For by grace you have been saved. But to us who are being saved. Much more shall we be saved. Salvation past is justification, salvation present is sanctification, salvation future is glorification. Another way is to say that in justification, God declares us just as if we were Christ. In sanctification God both treats us and makes us holy as Christ is holy. In glorification God makes us such partakers of the divine nature that he doesn’t have to squint at our holiness anymore. We are made really like Christ in whatever is communicable therein. Put it this way: In Adams fall, he gave the middle finger to God. Now we are all born giving the middle finger to God. Christ never did, he loved and obeyed. In justification, God see’s us as having put the middle finger down, in sanctification he helps us put our finger down, and in glorification he completes and finalizes the process. This, by the way, is the easiest analogy to see the relationship between works and salvation. How is sanctification tied to works? As the cause not as the result—don’t confuse the cart for the horse. Do not truncate salvation down to a prayer you prayed, or even down just to justification or down to anything else. God is one and likewise, salvation is one. God is three and likewise, accept of no other salvation than one that is all three of these. 3.4 Mistakes A few examples of common errors may be helpful. The Pharisees were proud of their past salvation but denied a need for ongoing and future holiness. The “Holiness Movement” as far as I understand it, saw the need for personal holiness but no such need for a justification in Christ by his work alone that would cause them to actually be sanctified and thus glorified in a way that gave God sole credit for salvation. The general bulk of humanity believes that God will one day save them when they die, not based on any sort of justification nor sanctification, but merely from God’s own goodness, I would liken this to a hope in glorification without a need for the other two. Charismatics tend to simplify salvation down to justification and justification down to an easy believism. But the important thing for Christian living is a second blessing, or being “activated” or being baptized in the Holy Spirit. Thus they get a lot right in practice while still missing so much. It is worth loving such as these, while also noticing that several of the churches in Revelation are failing because of their toleration of things that ought not be tolerated. Casting a large “salvation” net does not necessarily do God any favors, though it is usually done because of sympathy. Sympathy is a nice man-accomplishable version of holiness that needs no work of God to put on. It is born of the flesh, though thought of as acceptable of God. It is a watermelon, not an apple. Like Charismatics, Reformed folk tend to also simplify salvation down to justification. It’s sometimes amazing how similar reformed churches are to charismatic ones. But while charasmatics tend to err on the side of making their non-salvific sanctification something that God does in us apart from our working, reformers tend toward making their non-salvific sanctification something that we must try had to grow in and accomplish by our working. 3.5 Conclusions, Applications, and Whatnot This belongs under a chapter on assurance, but while we are here, I will point out that you have no real access to your justification nor your glorification. You have most access to your sanctification. And thus, your assurance and the proof of your salvation, justification, and glorification are all through your sanctification. Remember that the Holy Spirit is said to be the seal of our salvation, and spiritual sanctification is not different than the Spirit’s work in our life. All of this is not by our works. Christians tend to get (I hope) that we cannot earn our justification by our works. They tend to be bad at getting that salvation is not by our works either. Glorification then tends to be a mixed bag of earning it and not earning it. Please believe that all of salvation is not by our earning it. Just as there are legalists and Pharisees who look for their justification by works, there are also legalists and Pharisees who demand a sanctification by works. Both are obnoxious, but I think the sanctification legalists might cause the most damage in God’s churches. What we do believe is that justification does not accept of our works. It is God’s work alone and refuses to us have any part in it. It is monergistic. However sanctification does accept of our works. It is a work God does in us, we do have a part in it. It is synergistic. This helps me make sense of why it is so easy to get sanctification wrong. It accepts of our works but it is not by our works. There is a link between forgetting God’s works and who God is on the one hand, and then becoming weary of God and bored with God on the other hand. This leads to a lack of prayer, a lack of calling on God, a lack of noticing the absence of God. This progression should be thought on more, and I plan to do that in a chapter on the unforgivable sin.↩︎ Psa 50:21, Num 23:19, Isa 43:22, Jer 2:13↩︎ "],["communion-with-god.html", "Chapter 4 Communion with God", " Chapter 4 Communion with God "],["mortification.html", "Chapter 5 Mortification", " Chapter 5 Mortification "],["the-holy-spirit.html", "Chapter 6 The Holy Spirit", " Chapter 6 The Holy Spirit "],["the-trinity-v.html", "Chapter 7 The Trinity V", " Chapter 7 The Trinity V "],["seed-of-faith.html", "Chapter 8 Seed of Faith", " Chapter 8 Seed of Faith "],["church.html", "Chapter 9 Church", " Chapter 9 Church "],["a-house.html", "Chapter 10 A House", " Chapter 10 A House "],["does-it-work-for-family.html", "Chapter 11 Does it Work for Family", " Chapter 11 Does it Work for Family "],["old-man-new-man.html", "Chapter 12 Old Man / New Man", " Chapter 12 Old Man / New Man "],["regeneration.html", "Chapter 13 Regeneration", " Chapter 13 Regeneration "],["sovereignty.html", "Chapter 14 Sovereignty", " Chapter 14 Sovereignty "],["suffering.html", "Chapter 15 Suffering", " Chapter 15 Suffering "],["freedom-liberty.html", "Chapter 16 Freedom / Liberty", " Chapter 16 Freedom / Liberty "],["fear-and-shame.html", "Chapter 17 Fear and Shame", " Chapter 17 Fear and Shame "],["discernment.html", "Chapter 18 Discernment", " Chapter 18 Discernment "],["marriage-headship.html", "Chapter 19 Marriage / Headship", " Chapter 19 Marriage / Headship "],["universal-sincerity.html", "Chapter 20 Universal Sincerity", " Chapter 20 Universal Sincerity "],["hell-and-zombies.html", "Chapter 21 Hell and Zombies", " Chapter 21 Hell and Zombies "],["cleanness-vs-righteousness.html", "Chapter 22 Cleanness vs Righteousness", " Chapter 22 Cleanness vs Righteousness "],["sanctified-persons-vs-sanctified-actions.html", "Chapter 23 Sanctified Persons vs Sanctified Actions", " Chapter 23 Sanctified Persons vs Sanctified Actions "],["duty.html", "Chapter 24 Duty", " Chapter 24 Duty but to suppose that whatever God requireth of us that we have power of ourselves to do, is to make the cross and grace of Jesus Christ of none effect.
